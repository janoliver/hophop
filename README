Units
    Length
        The parameters specifying the length of the sample, are given in units
        of N^(-1/3). So choosing -l20 would result in 20*20*20 sites. 
        N^(-1/3) is thus also the length scale in the simulation. Internally, the 
        sample is split into cells of with 2 * --rc * --llength (cutoff radius 
        * loc. length). 
    
    
    Energies/Temperatures
        All energies are measured in units of the disorder parameter \sigma.
        Since 
    
            \sigma/kT \approx 3.0
        
        is a realistic value, the temperature T is usually around 0.3.
