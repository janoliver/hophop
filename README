Units
    Length
        The parameters specifying the length of the sample, are given in units
        of N^(-1/3). So choosing -l20 would result in 20*20*20 sites. 
        N^(-1/3) is thus also the length scale in the simulation. Internally, the 
        sample is split into cells of with 2 * --rc * --llength (cutoff radius 
        * loc. length). 
    
    
    Energies/Temperatures
        All energies are measured in units of the disorder parameter \sigma.
        Since 
    
            \sigma/kT \approx 3.0
        
        is a realistic value, the temperature T is usually around 0.3.

Coding style
    We use a modified gnu coding style. The code can and should be formatted
    using the indent tool like this:
 
       indent -gnu -fc1 -i4 -bli0 -nut -cdb -sc -bap -l80

   Block comments should look like this and precede functions etc.

      /*
       * I am a block comment!
       */

  For one-lined comments, use //
