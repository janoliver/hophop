This software simulates charge carrier movement through disordered
systems. It is capable of using the variable range mechanism as well as
some lattice structure. The energetic disorder can be specified as an
input parameter.
The software determines some key features of the charge transport such as
mobility, diffusivity, certain important energies and so on.
