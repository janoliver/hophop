hophop
======

*hophop* simulates charge carrier movement through disordered
systems. *hophop* determines some key features of the charge transport such as
mobility, diffusivity, certain important energies and so on.

* We acknowledge the creators of the supplementary libraries that *hophop* depends on, i.e.,
  `Lis <http://www.ssisc.org/lis/>`_, `GSL <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_, and
  `mgmres <http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/mgmres/mgmres.html>`_.
* Many of the algorithms were contributed by Dr. Alexey Nenashev. Thank you!
* Writing the code is greatly inspired by the work of Dr. Fredrik Jansson on disordered systems.
* Without supervision from Prof. Dr. Sergei Baranovskii, there would be no *hophop*.
