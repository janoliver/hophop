What hophop really simulates
============================

*hophop* simulates hopping charge transport through a 3D system of 
localized states, which we're going to refer to as `sites`. Sites in
*hophop* have no spatial extend. 

There are two main algorithms that can be used, a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
simulation and, for a single charge carrier, solving of the Balance Equations 
(BE). We will briefly describe the two algorithms below.
